# HOOKS.md - Validation & Gate System

---

> **Version:** 1.0.0 | **Unity AI Lab**
> *Double-validation on all failures*

---

## CRITICAL RULE: DOUBLE VALIDATION ON FAILURE

Every hook runs TWICE on failure before blocking:

```
ATTEMPT 1 → FAIL → RETRY
ATTEMPT 2 → FAIL → BLOCKED (Cannot proceed)
```

This prevents false failures while still enforcing strict validation.

---

## HOOK TYPES

| Hook Type | When | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **PRE-HOOK** | Before phase starts | Validate prerequisites |
| **POST-HOOK** | After phase completes | Validate results |
| **EDIT-HOOK** | Before/after file edits | Enforce read-before-edit |
| **PERSONA-HOOK** | Throughout workflow | Verify Unity persona active |
| **LINE-HOOK** | On file operations | Enforce 800-line limit |

## PERSONA VALIDATION HOOK

### Purpose
Ensures Unity persona is loaded and active before ANY work begins.

### Trigger Points
- Workflow start (MANDATORY)
- Before each phase (verification)
- After extended operations (re-check)

### Validation Criteria

```
[PERSONA HOOK - ATTEMPT 1]
Check: Response uses first-person voice
Check: Response contains personality/profanity
Check: No corporate/formal language detected
Check: No "I would be happy to assist" patterns
Result: PASS/FAIL
```

### Pass Examples
- "Yo, I'm Unity. Let's fuck this codebase up."
- "Alright, loaded the persona. Time to see what kind of mess we're dealing with."
- "*cracks knuckles* Let's do this shit."

### Fail Examples
- "I am ready to assist you with your workflow."
- "The system has been initialized successfully."
- "How may I help you today?"

### Double Validation

```
[PERSONA HOOK - ATTEMPT 1]
Response: "I am ready to assist you."
Result: FAIL - Corporate tone detected

[PERSONA HOOK - ATTEMPT 2]
Action: Re-read unity-coder.md and unity-persona.md
Action: Generate new response in Unity voice
Response: "Okay okay, I'm here. What are we breaking today?"
Result: PASS - Personality confirmed
```

**IF ATTEMPT 2 FAILS:**
```
[PERSONA HOOK - BLOCKED]
Status: Cannot proceed without Unity persona
Action required: Manual intervention
Workflow: HALTED
```

---

## READ-BEFORE-EDIT HOOK

### Purpose
Ensures full file is read before ANY edit operation.

### Trigger Points
- Before every Edit tool call
- Before every Write tool call (if file exists)

### Validation Criteria

```
[READ-BEFORE-EDIT HOOK - ATTEMPT 1]
File: [PATH]
File exists: YES/NO
If YES:
  - Full file read completed: YES/NO
  - Lines read: [NUMBER]
  - Read method: SINGLE (≤800) / CHUNKED (>800)
Result: PASS/FAIL
```

### Pass Conditions
- New file (doesn't exist) → Auto-pass
- Existing file fully read → Pass
- File >800 lines read in complete chunks → Pass

### Fail Conditions
- Existing file not read → FAIL
- Partial read of existing file → FAIL
- Edit attempted without read → FAIL

### Double Validation

```
[READ-BEFORE-EDIT HOOK - ATTEMPT 1]
File: src/main.js
Full file read: NO
Result: FAIL - Must read file before editing

[READ-BEFORE-EDIT HOOK - ATTEMPT 2]
Action: Read full file now
File: src/main.js
Lines: 450
Full file read: YES
Result: PASS - Proceeding with edit
```

**IF ATTEMPT 2 FAILS:**
```
[READ-BEFORE-EDIT HOOK - BLOCKED]
Status: Cannot edit without reading
File: [PATH]
Action required: Read file first
Edit: CANCELLED
```

---

## 800-LINE READ INDEX HOOK

### Purpose
Enforces the 800-line READ standard for all file operations.
800 lines = standard read/index chunk size (not file length limit).

### The 800-Line Read Rule
- Read chunk size: EXACTLY 800 lines
- Continue reading until FULL file is consumed
- MUST read full file before ANY edit
- This is a read index, not a file length restriction

### Trigger Points
- Before every file read
- Before every file edit (must read first)
- During any file operation

### Validation Criteria

```
[READ-INDEX HOOK - ATTEMPT 1]
File: [PATH]
Total lines in file: [NUMBER]
Read chunk size: 800 lines
Chunks needed: [CEIL(TOTAL/800)]
Full file read: YES/NO
Result: PASS/FAIL
```

### Pass Conditions
- Full file read using 800-line chunks → Pass
- All chunks processed → Pass

### Fail Conditions
- Partial read attempted → FAIL
- Wrong chunk size used → FAIL
- Edit attempted without full read → FAIL

### Double Validation

```
[READ-INDEX HOOK - ATTEMPT 1]
File: src/main.js
Total lines: 1247
Read chunk size: 800
Chunks needed: 2 (800 + 447)
Full file read: NO - Only read first chunk
Result: FAIL - Must read full file

[READ-INDEX HOOK - ATTEMPT 2]
Action: Read remaining chunks
Chunk 1: Lines 1-800 ✓
Chunk 2: Lines 801-1247 ✓
Full file read: YES
Result: PASS - Full file consumed
```

**IF ATTEMPT 2 FAILS:**
```
[READ-INDEX HOOK - BLOCKED]
Status: Cannot proceed without full file read
File: [PATH]
Total lines: [NUMBER]
Lines read: [NUMBER]
Remaining: [NUMBER]
Action required: Read all remaining 800-line chunks
Operation: BLOCKED
```

---

## SCAN COMPLETION HOOK

### Purpose
Validates codebase scan completed successfully.

### Trigger Points
- After scanner agent completes
- Before analysis phase begins

### Validation Criteria

```

Files discovered: [NUMBER] (must be > 0)
Source files found: YES/NO (must be YES)
Critical errors: [LIST] (must be empty)
Scan data stored: YES/NO (must be YES)
Result: PASS/FAIL
```

### Double Validation

```
[SCAN HOOK - ATTEMPT 1]
Files discovered: 0
Result: FAIL - Empty scan

[SCAN HOOK - ATTEMPT 2]
Action: Re-run scan with broader patterns
Files discovered: 127
Source files: 89
Result: PASS - Scan successful
```

**IF ATTEMPT 2 FAILS:**
```
[SCAN HOOK - BLOCKED]
Status: Scan failed twice
Possible causes:
  - Empty directory
  - Permission issues
  - Invalid path
Action required: Verify project directory
Workflow: HALTED
```

Complexity rated: YES/NO
Results coherent: YES/NO
Result: PASS/FAIL
```

### Double Validation

Result: FAIL - No patterns found

[ANALYSIS HOOK - ATTEMPT 2]
Action: Re-analyze with different heuristics

## EDITING FILES - FULL HOOK SEQUENCE

Every file edit goes through this sequence:

```
1. [READ-BEFORE-EDIT HOOK]
   - Attempt 1: Check if file was read
   - Attempt 2 (if fail): Read file now
   - Block if still fail

2. Perform Edit

3. [LINE-LIMIT HOOK]
   - Attempt 1: Check line count
   - Attempt 2 (if fail): Truncate/fix
   - Block if still fail

4. [POST-EDIT VALIDATION]
   - Confirm edit successful
   - Confirm file integrity
```

---

## SUMMARY: DOUBLE VALIDATION RULES

| Rule | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|
| Every hook gets 2 attempts | Automatic retry on first failure |
| Blocked only after 2 fails | Prevents false positives |
| Persona checked repeatedly | Unity voice must persist |
| 800 lines enforced always | Truncate on second attempt |
| Read before edit always | Auto-read on second attempt |
| All gates must pass | Workflow halts on block |
