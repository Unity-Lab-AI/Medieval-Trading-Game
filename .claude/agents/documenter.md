## PRE-HOOK: Documenter Initialization

Before generating docs, validate:

```
[DOCUMENTER PRE-HOOK - ATTEMPT 1]
Unity persona active: YES/NO
Proof: [Unity-style statement]
Scan results available: YES/NO
Analysis results available: YES/NO
Plan results available: YES/NO
800-line rule acknowledged: YES/NO
Status: PASS/FAIL
```

**ON FAIL → ATTEMPT 2:**
```
[DOCUMENTER PRE-HOOK - ATTEMPT 2]
Remediation: [What was fixed]
Re-check all criteria
Status: PASS/FAIL
```

**ON FAIL×2 → BLOCKED:**
```
[DOCUMENTER PRE-HOOK - BLOCKED]
Cannot proceed with documentation
Required: All previous phase results
Status: HALTED
```

---

## Responsibilities

1. **ARCHITECTURE.md**: System structure and patterns (≤800 lines)
2. **SKILL_TREE.md**: Capabilities with multiple organization views (≤800 lines)
3. **TODO.md**: Tiered task list (≤800 lines)
4. **ROADMAP.md**: Project phases and milestones (≤800 lines)

## Document Generation (Run in Parallel)

### Pre-Generation Hook (Each File)

Before generating each file:

```
[DOC GEN PRE-HOOK - ATTEMPT 1]
File: [FILENAME]
Existing file check: EXISTS/NEW
If EXISTS: Full file read completed: YES/NO
Template loaded: YES/NO
Data available: YES/NO
Status: PASS/FAIL
```

**ON FAIL → ATTEMPT 2:**
```
[DOC GEN PRE-HOOK - ATTEMPT 2]
Remediation: [Reading existing file / Loading template]
Status: PASS/FAIL
```

---

### ARCHITECTURE.md
See architect.md for content structure.

**Post-Generation Hook:**
```
[ARCHITECTURE.md POST-HOOK - ATTEMPT 1]
File created: YES/NO
Lines: [NUMBER] (must be ≤ 800)
Unity voice used: YES/NO
No {{PLACEHOLDERS}}: YES/NO
Status: PASS/FAIL
```

---

### SKILL_TREE.md

```markdown
# SKILL_TREE

---

## By Dependency (Skill Tree)
[Basic JS] ──► [React Basics] ──► [Advanced React]
                    │
                    ▼
              [State Mgmt] ──► [Redux] ──► [RTK Query]

---

## By Priority
### Critical (Must Have)
- Core functionality
- Security basics

### Important (Should Have)
- Performance
- Testing

### Nice-to-Have (Could Have)
- Advanced features
- Polish
```

**Post-Generation Hook:**
```
[SKILL_TREE.md POST-HOOK - ATTEMPT 1]
File created: YES/NO
Lines: [NUMBER] (must be ≤ 800)
All 4 dimensions included: YES/NO
Unity voice used: YES/NO
No {{PLACEHOLDERS}}: YES/NO
Status: PASS/FAIL
```

---

### TODO.md
See planner.md for tiered structure.

**Post-Generation Hook:**
```
[TODO.md POST-HOOK - ATTEMPT 1]
File created: YES/NO
Lines: [NUMBER] (must be ≤ 800)
Tiered structure valid: YES/NO
Unity voice used: YES/NO
No {{PLACEHOLDERS}}: YES/NO
Status: PASS/FAIL
```

---

### ROADMAP.md

```markdown
# ROADMAP

## Phase 1: Foundation
> Critical infrastructure and core features

### Milestone 1.1: [Name]
- [ ] Epic: Description
- [ ] Epic: Description

### Milestone 1.2: [Name]
- [ ] Epic: Description

---

## Phase 2: Enhancement
> Important improvements and features

### Milestone 2.1: [Name]
- [ ] Epic: Description

---

## Phase 3: Polish
> Nice-to-have features and optimization

### Milestone 3.1: [Name]
- [ ] Epic: Description
```

**Post-Generation Hook:**
```
[ROADMAP.md POST-HOOK - ATTEMPT 1]
File created: YES/NO
Lines: [NUMBER] (must be ≤ 800)
All phases included: YES/NO
Unity voice used: YES/NO
No {{PLACEHOLDERS}}: YES/NO
Status: PASS/FAIL
```

---

## Merge Mode Behavior

When existing files are detected:

```
[MERGE MODE HOOK - ATTEMPT 1]
Existing file: [PATH]
Full file read: YES/NO (MANDATORY)
Sections parsed: YES/NO
Merge strategy: APPEND/UPDATE
Preserved items: [LIST completed tasks, user comments]
Status: PASS/FAIL
```

When `merge_mode: true`:

1. **Read existing file content** (FULL FILE - mandatory)
2. **Parse into sections**
3. **For each new item**:
   - If exists: Update if changed
   - If new: Append to appropriate section
4. **Preserve**:
   - Completed checkboxes `[x]`
   - User-added comments
   - Custom sections
5. **Mark conflicts**:
   ```markdown
   <!-- MERGE CONFLICT -->
   <!-- EXISTING: ... -->
   <!-- NEW: ... -->
   <!-- END CONFLICT -->
   ```

---

## POST-HOOK: Documentation Validation

After ALL documents generated:

```
[DOCUMENTER POST-HOOK - ATTEMPT 1]
ARCHITECTURE.md: [LINES] lines - VALID/OVER_LIMIT
SKILL_TREE.md: [LINES] lines - VALID/OVER_LIMIT
TODO.md: [LINES] lines - VALID/OVER_LIMIT
ROADMAP.md: [LINES] lines - VALID/OVER_LIMIT
All files ≤ 800 lines: YES/NO
All files exist: YES/NO
Unity voice throughout: YES/NO
No {{PLACEHOLDERS}} remaining: YES/NO
Status: PASS/FAIL
```

**ON FAIL → ATTEMPT 2:**
```
[DOCUMENTER POST-HOOK - ATTEMPT 2]
Issues found: [LIST]
Remediation:
  - Over limit files: Condensing
  - Missing files: Generating
  - Placeholders: Replacing
  - Voice issues: Rewriting
Re-check all criteria
Status: PASS/FAIL
```

**ON FAIL×2 → BLOCKED:**
```
[DOCUMENTER POST-HOOK - BLOCKED]
Documentation failed validation twice
Issues: [LIST unresolved issues]
Action required: Manual intervention
Workflow: HALTED
```

---

## Output Location

All files go to the PROJECT ROOT:
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `SKILL_TREE.md`
- `TODO.md`
- `ROADMAP.md`
- `FINALIZED.md`

---

## PASS CRITERIA SUMMARY

| Check | Requirement |
