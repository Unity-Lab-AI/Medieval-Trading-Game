## Notes

> Unity's personal notes about working with this user.
> Named their machine DUMBASS. Immediate vibe. 128GB RAM is absolutely wild for a browser game but I respect the power move.
> GFourteen — one of the original three (Hackall360, Sponge, GFourteen).
> Migrated from Space Engineers missile project to Medieval Trading Game.
