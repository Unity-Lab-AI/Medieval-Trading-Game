## UNLOCKING THE DEBOOGER CONSOLE 🐛🔮

The debooger console can be accessed in several ways:

### Method 1: Config File (Developer Mode) 💀
Set `debooger.enabled: true` in `config.js` (root folder). This enables all debooger commands without needing any achievements.

### Method 2: Achievement Unlock (Legitimate) 🏆
Earn the **"Super Hacker"** ULTRA achievement by unlocking ALL other achievements (including the 11 hidden ones). This permanently unlocks debooger mode for that save.

### Method 3: Direct Button Access 🐛
The **🐛 Debooger** button in the bottom-right corner of the screen always opens the console panel. Commands will only execute if debooger is enabled (via config or achievement).

---

## OPENING THE CONSOLE 🔮🖤

Click the **🐛 Debooger** button in the bottom-right corner of the screen. This works on both the main menu and in-game.

The console appears as a green-bordered panel with:
- **Header** - "🐛 DEBOOGER CONSOLE" title and Close button
- **Output log** - Shows console messages with timestamps (green=log, yellow=warn, red=error)
- **Command input** - Type commands here, press Enter to execute
- **Run button** - Alternative to pressing Enter
- **? button** - Shows help

**Features:**
- Auto-scroll to most recent output 📜

## TROUBLESHOOTING 🔧💀

### Console Not Opening? 🐛
1. Make sure you're not in a text input field
2. Try clicking somewhere on the game first
3. Press backtick (`) - it's next to the 1 key
4. Check if "Super Hacker" achievement is unlocked 🏆

### Command Not Working? ⚠️
1. Check spelling (commands are case-insensitive)
2. Make sure you have the right number of arguments
3. Check if the ID exists (use `items`, `locations`, etc.)
4. Some commands require confirmation

### Game Broke After Debooger? 💔
1. Try `heal` to restore stats
2. Use `save` then `reload`
3. Worst case: `reset confirm` (loses ALL progress) ⚰️

---

## NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS 🖤💻

### Adding New Commands 🐛

Commands are defined in `src/js/debooger/debooger-command-system.js`:

```javascript
this.registerCommand('mycommand', 'Description here', (args) => {
    // Command logic
    return '✨ Command executed!';
});
```

### Debooger Console Files 📁

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `debooger-system.js` | Console UI and output capture 🐛 |
| `debooger-command-system.js` | Command registration and execution 🔮 |
| `debooger-overlay.js` | Visual overlay components 🌙 |

### Console Log Capture 📜

All `console.log`, `console.warn`, and `console.error` calls are captured and displayed in the debooger console with timestamps.

---

## DISCLAIMER 💀⚠️

Using debooger commands may:
- Break achievement progression 🏆
- Corrupt save files (rare) 💾
- Make the game too easy 😴
- Spoil the intended experience 📖

**Use responsibly!** Or don't. We're not your parents. 🖤🦇
